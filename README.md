# odin-landing_page
Project: Landing Page

This is the second project to work after finishing the "Flexbox"

Github Web: https://rightbear.github.io/odin-landing_page/

(2024/12/26) I complete this project with knowledges of Flex I learned in the course. I also add other HTML &  CSS functions to this project. This activity strengths my skills in HTML, CSS and Flex.

(2024/12/27) I review other participants' works online and give my project some modification. Mainly adjust suitable name of class in HTML and add better layout method (like using flex-basis, margin... etc.) in CSS.
